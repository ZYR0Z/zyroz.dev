    <h3 id="what-is-a-compiler">What is a Compiler?</h3>
<p>A Compiler is like a machine, which turns high-level, human-readable code into binray code. At its core, a compiler is a software tool that takes your source code written in a high-level programming language (like Python, Java, or C++) and converts it into a lower-level representation, usually machine code or assembly language. This process enables computers to execute your program&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<h3 id="parts-of-a-compiler">Parts of a Compiler</h3>
<p>A compiler consists of several stages, each with a specific purpose:</p>
<h3 id="1-lexer">1. <strong>Lexer</strong></h3>
<p>This stage breaks down the source code into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. It removes whitespace and comments, preparing the code for further processing.</p>
<h3 id="2-parser">2. <strong>Parser:</strong></h3>
<p>The parser takes the tokens produced by the lexer and constructs a syntax tree. This tree represents the hierarchical structure of your code and ensures it follows the rules of the programming language&rsquo;s grammar.</p>
<h3 id="3-semantic-analysis">3. <strong>Semantic Analysis:</strong></h3>
<p>Here, the compiler checks the code for logical and semantic correctness. It identifies type errors, undeclared variables, and other inconsistencies that could lead to runtime errors.</p>
<h3 id="4-intermediate-code-generation">4. <strong>Intermediate Code Generation:</strong></h3>
<p>Some compilers generate an intermediate representation of the code at this stage. This intermediate code is more abstract and easier to work with than the original source code, making subsequent optimization and code generation phases more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="5-optimization">5. <strong>Optimization:</strong></h3>
<p>The compiler looks for opportunities to optimize the code. This might involve simplifying expressions, eliminating redundant instructions, and rearranging code to improve performance.</p>
<h3 id="6-code-generation">6. <strong>Code Generation:</strong></h3>
<p>In this phase, the compiler generates the target machine code or assembly language. It maps the high-level language constructs to sequences of low-level instructions that the computer&rsquo;s hardware can execute.</p>
<h3 id="how-a-compiler-works">How a Compiler Works</h3>
<p>The compilation process follows these general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You write your source code in a high-level programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lexer breaks down the code into tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parser constructs a syntax tree based on the tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler performs semantic analysis to ensure correctness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If used, an intermediate representation might be generated and optimized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler generates machine code or assembly language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resulting binary code is ready to be executed by the computer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
